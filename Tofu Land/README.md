## Game assets
My tofu is able to jump and move around. The enemys will knock back the tofu when they collide. The tofu can kill the enemy and get a boost up
when the tofu jumps on top of the enemy's head. Spikes will kill the tofu and make it respawn at a set spawnpoint area. The enemys will also damage
the tofu and if the tofu reaches 0 health it will respawn.

## Types of Enemys
I have a regular enemy, a hopping enemy, and a enemy that follows the tofu. Also there are all of the enemys that randomly spawn.

# Known Bugs

# Spawning Error
I have an additional feature where enemy's will spawn randomly around the map, however, they spawn behind the other tiles so you cannot see the
enemys that have spawned

## Video Solution
Video of the game (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VqERwPzdECl3DAoIeejCd-0ofKARnl-/view)

When watching the video, you will see that the top left enemy and the jumping enemy get stuck in place. This is because there are other enemys in their way that spawned at random that you are unable to see since they are behind the tiles. However, my tofu still killed both enemys. Also, my tofu may have respawned randomly, that is because the enemys do damage to my tofu so they killed my tofu and made it respawn. The spikes also made my tofu respawn when the tofu made contact.
