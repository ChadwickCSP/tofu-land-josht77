## Game assets
My tofu is able to jump and move around. The enemys will knock back the tofu when they collide. The tofu can kill the enemy and get a boost up
when the tofu jumps on top of the enemy's head. Spikes will kill the tofu and make it respawn at a set spawnpoint area. The enemys will also damage
the tofu and if the tofu reaches 0 health it will respawn.

## Types of Enemys
I have a regular enemy, a hopping enemy, and a enemy that follows the tofu. Also there are all of the enemys that randomly spawn.

# Known Bugs

# Spawning Error
I have an additional feature where enemy's will spawn randomly around the map, however, they spawn behind the other tiles so you cannot see the
enemys that have spawned
